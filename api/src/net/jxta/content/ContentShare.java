/**
 * ContentShare objects represent the server / data provider portion
 * of a Content transfer mechanism.  ContentShare instances are
 * obtained through the use of a ContentProvider's
 * <code>shareContent</code> method.  Although this interface only
 * defines the bare minimum functionality required to work with shared
 * Content it was designed to be extended by provider implementations
 * such that more detailed information and control over the share
 * can be achieved.  For example, some providers may wish to expose
 * controls allowing programmatic control over the amount of bandwidth
 * which is allowed to be consumed by the transmission of the Content to
 * other peers.  Other provider implementations may simply provide
 * more detailed telemetry for the end-user to obtain and use in their
 * applications.
 * <p/>
 * An explicit effort was made when this API was created to ensure that
 * ContentShare objects created by providers would always be directly
 * accessible to the end user of the shares.  This maintains the end
 * user's ability to use type comparison (e.g., instanceof) to identify
 * a specific provider's share programmatically, allowing a typecast or
 * bean introspection to provide access to more comprehensive tuning
 * controls and interfaces.
 * <p/>
 * In addition to providing direct access, this interface also allows
 * for the possibility of a single Content instance to be provisioned
 * by multiple ContentProvider implementations concurrently on a single peer.
 * Each ContentProvider will provide a ContentShareAdvertisement describing
 * it's contact information (understandable by other instances of the
 * same ContentProvider), allowing remote peers (potentially) multiple
 * means by which to obtain the Content.  ContentProvider implementations are
 * only responsible for providing this advertisement to the end-user and
 * should not publish the advertisement to remote peers.
