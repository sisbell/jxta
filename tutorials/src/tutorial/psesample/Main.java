/**
 * A sample program which demonstrates usage of the JXTA PSE Membership Service.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>This sample is focused upon secure management of certificate chains,
 * certificate signing and identity management. It implements a peergroup which
 * provides four types of users:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Owner</li>
 * <li>Administrator</li>
 * <li>Member</li>
 * <li>Invitee</li>
 * <li>Interloper (not valid)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>Each of these user types has certain abilities within the peergroup.
 * <p/>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Owner</dt>
 * <dd>Peer Group Owners have all rights within the group and are the owner
 * of the private key for the group's root certificate. Peers may become the
 * Peer Group Owner by knowing the password used to encrypt the peer group's
 * private key. The Peer Group Owner may designate peers as Administrators by
 * signing their certificate with the peer group private key.</dd>
 * <p/>
 * <dt>Administrator<dt>
 * <dd>Peer Group Administrators are peers designated by the Peer Group
 * Owners to have rights beyond that of regular Member peers. Administrator
 * peers may generate peer group invitations and may validate Member peers.
 * Administrator peers have their certifcate signed with the peer group owner
 * private key. Administrators can sign the certificate of Peer Group Invitees
 * to allow them to become Peer Group Members. Administrators can generate
 * Peer Group invitations which can be used by peers to join the peer group.
 * A Peer Group invitation contains a certificate signed with the
 * Administrator's private key and the matching private. The private key is
 * encryped with a password. To use the invitation a peer must know the
 * password for the invitations private key.</dd>
 * <p/>
 * <dt>Member</dt>
 * <dd>Peer Group Members are the standard user class for this sample. Peer
 * Group Members have a certificate that is signed with the private key of a
 * Peer Group Administrator (which in turn is signed with the private key of a
 * Peer Group Owner). Peer Group Members can request their certificate to be
 * signed by a Peer Group Owner in order to become a Peer Group Administrator.
 * <dd>
 * <p/>
 * <dt>Invitee</dt>
 * <dd>Peer Group Invitees are peers who's certificate is signed by an
 * invitation certificate. Invitees sign their own certificate with the private
 * key from the Peer Group invitation they used when first joining the peer
 * group. Peer Group Invitees can request that their certificate be signed by
 * a Peer Group Adminstrator in order to become a Peer Group Member.</dd>
 * <p/>
 * <dt>Interloper</dt>
 * <dd>Peer Group Interlopers are unauthorized peers who do not have a
 * correctly signed certificate. Interloper peers may attempt to interact with
 * other peers within the peer group, but all of their requests will be
 * ignored without the correct certificates. While potentially annoying Peer
 * Group Interloper peers are easily detected and can do no harm within the
 * peer group.</dd>

    /**
     * Build the Peer Group Advertisement for the PSE Sample Peer Group.
     * <p/>
     * <p/>The Peer Group Advertisement will be generated to contain an
     * invitation certificate chain and encrypted private key. Peers which
     * know the password for the Peer Group Root Certificate Key can generate
     * their own invitation otherwise peers must get an invitation from
     * another group member.
     * <p/>
     * <p/>The invitation certificate chain appears in two forms:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Self Invitation : PSE Sample Group Root Certificate + Encrypted Private Key</li>
     * <li>Regular Invitation :
     * <ul>
     * <li>Invitation Certificate + Encrpyted Private Key</li>
     * <li>Peer Group Member Certificate</li>
     * <li>Peer Group Administrator Certificate</li>
     * <li>PSE Sample Group Root Certificate</li>
     * </ul></li>
     * </ul>
     * <p/>
     * <p/>Invitations are provided to prospective peer group members. You can
     * use a unique invitation for each prospective member or a single
     * static invitation for every prospective member. If you use a static
     * invitation certificate keep in mind that every copy will use the same
     * shared password and thus the invitation will provide only very limited
     * security.
     * <p/>
     * <p/>In some applications the invitation password will be built in to the
     * application and the human user will never have to know of it's use.
     * This can be useful if you wish your PSE Peer Group used only by a single
     * application.
