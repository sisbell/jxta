<p> This project redefines ID's using the concept of CBID's
(crypto-based ID's) which has recently been proposed as a very powerful
and decentralised tool for network layer security. These CBID's will be
applied to Peers and Peer Groups to prevent impersonation and
redirection attacks. They also allow the strong authentication to
bootstrap secure channels and authorization. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><a name="Plan"> Plan </a></h2>
<p> Recently, there has been much activity to give nodes in a network
cryptographic identifiers, or CBID's [SUCV]. These have been applied to
Mobile IPv6 [SUCV-DRAFT], Neighbor Discovery [SeND], Securing Group
Management [SGM], securing ad hoc networks [cb-manet], Opportunistic
Encryption [OE6], etc. </p>
<p> In particular, the ad hoc networks proposal has strong similarities
with JXTA both in the types of impersonation attacks that can be
launched, the impossibility of relying on a centralised authentication
infrastructure and the possible solution space for securing the routing
and discovery process. </p>
<p> This project aims at applying these concepts by redefining JXTA ID's
for Peers and Peer Groups (perhaps others later on) and using CBID's (by
which a peer or peer group can prove it owns its identifier).
Furthermore, the concept of delegation via certificates allows a
peergroup to securely delegate certain rights (or authorizations) to a
given peer (or to another peergroup). </p>
<p> The above will give JXTA verifiable ID's to secure discovering
routes to a destination peer, as well as secure (potentially
confidential) groups. </p>
<p> There is new, interesting work on security for ad hoc networks
[Working-session] which could be applied to JXTA as well. In particular,
CBID's could be used for an initial authentication after which
lightweight hash chains could be used for repeated operations. </p>
<p> Future extensions of this project could apply CBID's to secure
distributed hash tables as implemented, for example, by the Distributed
Indexing ("DI") JXTA project [di]. </p>
<p> This project also introduces a new protocol: the Sceau (Secure
Cocktail Effect Authentication) protocol. It aims at bootstraping a
secure communication channel between users where the destination user is
authenticated. Once the authentication is done 'standard security tools'
can be used to achieve strong security performance. The Sceau protocol
is asymmetric and provides authentication of the destination user. (This
can, of course, be repeated in the other way around to authenticate
both users). It relies on a "human" authentic channel where users
exchange a user friendly representation of their CBID. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><a name="Current_Status"> Current Status </a></h2>
<p>The core CBJX functionality has been integrated into the JXTA JSE platform.
Additional CBJX functionality, such as described below, has been proposed. 
We are currently looking for contributors to this project!</p>

<p> We also proposed several MembershipService implementations that use
authorization certificates (SPKI Certificates) to prove membership
within a group. Those authorization certificates are included in
credentials and can be used when contacting group services (this part is
not implemented because it depends on the service's access policy). The
three membership services are: </p>
<ul>
  <li> NullCbJxMembershipService: Gives certification to anybody asking
for it. Moreover delegation is      enabled meaning that each member can
authorize new peers to join the group. </li>
  <li> BootstrapMembershipService: This service uses the list of peers
identified by the boostrap process      (see the sceau protocol) as an
access list to authorize peers to join the group. Here again delegation
is enabled. </li>
  <li> UniqueNameMembershipService: Very similar to the previous one.
The differences are that requested name      must be unique within the
group. This is ensured by the group controller which is the peer who
created the group and therefore delegation  is disabled. (avoid the need
to distribute the list of used name) </li>
</ul>
<p> Applications running the sceau protocol are also provided: </p>
<ul>
  <li> myJXTA: a new application tab called Sceau has been added and it
can be used to bootstrap secure      communication between users and/or
construct the access list for the membership services.      (Some issues
to establish secure communications remains unsolved, e.g. the link
between known peers,      identified by a localy unique name chosen by
the user, and the other applications of myJXTA refering to other peers
with their peername  which are not unique) </li>
  <li> JXTAShell: some commands have been added in a similar fashion.
The most important one is 'getCBID'.      For more information refer to
the man pages in the JXTAShell. </li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><a name="Future_plans"> Future plans </a></h2>
<p> Some topics remains unaddressed in this project and needs to be
solved in the future: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Securing the Endpoint Routing Protocol: CBIDs can be used to
secure the route discovery      protocol by allowing only destination
nodes or a set of trusted node to respond to      route discovery
queries. </li>
  <li> DHT (Distributed Hashtables): This topic is still under research
and no solutions has been      proposed so far. (could be related to the
DI (Distributing Indexing) project or to the GISP project). </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="CB_PeerID_Crypto_Based_Peer_Iden"> CB-PeerID (Crypto-Based
Peer Identifier): </a></h3>
<a name="GeneratingCbids"></a>
<h4><a name="Generating_CBIDs"> </a> Generating CBIDs </h4>
A CB-PeerID is used to identify a peer securely.      Instead of being
generated in a pseudo-random manner the CB-PeerId is derived      from
the hash of a self-generated X.509 certificates and thus presents
similar uniqueness properties as UUID's (Universally Unique IDentifier)
that are currently      used in JXTA and generated in a pseudo random
manner. We propose to call this new ID type "cbid" instead of "uuid".
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li> the cbid will be generated as follow:
      <ul>
        <li> generate an X.509 certificate for the peer (RSA keys) </li>
        <li> hash this certificate and preserve only 128 bits from the
hash to generate            the cbid (hash SHA-1) </li>
        <li> Notes:
          <ul>
            <li> the code of the platform module has to be modified to
works with cbids' </li>
            <li> the code for the cbids' will be inspired from the
uuids' code since only               the way they are genrated is
different </li>
            <li> the certificate will be generated by the package
net.jxta.impl.endpoint.tls </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p> <a name="SendingMessages"></a> </p>
<h4><a name="Sending_a_Message"> Sending a Message </a></h4>
When a peer sends out a message it must prove that it owns its ID. It
will do so by including its self-generated certificate and signing the
message with its      private key.
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li> to include these elements in the message we propose the
following solution:
      <ul>
        <li> Define a new EndpointProtocol: the CbJxEndpointProtocol
          <ul>
            <li> When a message is sent to an EndpointDestinationAddress
of the form               cbjx://<destination Peer Id> it will go
through the CbJxEndpoint protocol               that will change the
destination address and store the old one into the message, it will also
sign the message with the peer's private key and add the peer X509
certificate. </li>
            <li> The new destination of the message will be of the form
jxta://<destination Peer ID>/CbJxService/some_params. That means
that the               message will now be sent through the
EndPointRouting protocol as any usual               messages. </li>
            <li> The second part of the address
(/CbJxService/some_params) means that the               message is
destined to the CbJxService. </li>
            <li> Note:
              <ul>
                <li> The CbJxEndpointProtocol implements
net.jxta.endpoint.MessageSender and net.jxta.endpoint.MessageReceiver.
It uses the messenger of the EndpointRoutingProtocol to send messages. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Sending_a_propagate_message"> Sending a propagate message </a></h4>
The EndpointService sends out propagate messages by calling the
"propagate" method      of each registred EndpointProtocol. The only
protocol that really sends out those      messages is the tcp endpoint.
That means that those messages will never go through the CbJxEndpoint.
In order to address this problem we propose the following solution:
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li> Use an EndpointFilterListner: the CbJxOutputFilter.
      <ul>
        <li> this EndpointFilter is called by the EndpointService when
it sends out               a message. This CbJxOutputFilter is then
responsible to add the peer certificate               and sign the
message. </li>
        <li> this EndpointFilterListener does not change the destination
address because              the destination address of a propagate
message is null. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<a name="ReceivingMessages"></a>
<h4><a name="Receiving_a_message_"> Receiving a message. </a></h4>
When a peer receives a message with a signature and a peer X.509
certificate it needs to check      its validity. If the message is valid
it will be delivred to the appropriate destination      service
otherwise it will simply be discarded.
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li> to perform those operations we propose the following solution:
      <ul>
        <li> Use another EndpointFilterListener: the CbJxInputFilter
          <ul>
            <li> this EndpointFilter will check incoming messages (The
verification is done by checking that the source peerID is derived from
the certificate               contained in the message and that the
signature of the message is valid.               (that will prove that
the sender owns the corresponding private key). </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Define a new EndpointListener: the CbJxService
          <ul>
            <li> In JXTA services registred to the endpoint service use
listeners to be               notified of new incoming messages. This
mechanism is widely used within JXTA               and that's the one we
will use for our service. </li>
            <li> As we said before a standard message (not a propagate
one) is destined to the               CbJxService(remember the change of
destination address performed by the CbJxEndpointProtocol). The
CbJxService will simply put back the original destination address that
was part of the message and give the message back to the
endpointService that will delivered it to the appropriate service. </li>
            <li> Notes:
              <ul>
                <li> The CbJxService needs to implement EndpointListener
to be notified of                  incoming messages. This service can
be handle by the CbJxEndpointProtocol. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

<h3><a name="CB_GroupID_Crypto_Based_Group_Id"> CB-GroupID (Crypto-Based
Group Identifier): </a></h3>
<a name="GeneratingCbids"></a>
<h4><a name="Generating_CBIDs"> </a> Generating CBIDs </h4>
A CB-GroupID is a UUID used to identify a group securely.      Instead
of being generated in a pseudo-random manner the CB-GroupId is derived
from the hash of an X.509 self-generated certificate and thus presents
similar uniqueness properties. Hashing the certificates and not only the
public key allow      more flexibilty.      We propose to call this new
ID type "cbid" instead of "uuid".
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li> the cbid will be generated as follow:
      <ul>
        <li> generate an X.509 certificate and thus a pair of
public-private key (RSA Keys). </li>
        <li> hash the certificate and preserve only 128 bits from the
hash to generate             the cbid (hash SHA-1) </li>
        <li> Notes:
          <ul>
            <li> the generation of self-generated X509 certificates is
done by the class                net.jxta.impl.endpoint.tls.PeerCerts </li>
            <li> the certificate and the encrypted private key are
stored into a file named               "groupName.pem" </li>

<h4><a name="Creating_a_PeerGroup"> Creating a PeerGroup </a></h4>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li> The peer that creates a new group is in charge to generate the
root certificate for the         group. He will of course generate the
new peergroup advertisement and publish it.         As we need a new
policy to join a CB-Group we will need a new MembershipService. The peer
who creates a new group is also in charge to generate the module
specifications related to this change of membership service and to
publish         those module specification within the parent peergroup. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Joining_a_PeerGroup"> Joining a PeerGroup </a></h4>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li> When you want to join a CB-Group you must used the approriate
membership service         which is specified in the group
advertisement. When calling the apply method of the         membership
service you will contact the membership service of the group and will
get back a certificate list (if you are accepted to join the group). You
may then use this         certificate list to prove your membership into
the group.         Currently the certificate list contains both X509
certificates and SPKI certificates.
      <ul>
        <li> the X509 certificate is a self-generated certificate and it
contains the group name            and the group public key. </li>
        <li> the SPKI certificate is an authorization certificate and
currently it's the group            public key that gives membersip
authorization to the hash of a peer X509 certificate            (= the
peer cbid). The SPKI allows to use a delegation tag to authorize other
peer to            admit new members within the group. This is used in
the NullCbJxMembership service            and in the
BootstrapMembershipService. </li>
