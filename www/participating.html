  <h1>Participating in the JXSE (JXSE) Project</h1>
  (Updated 2007-12-7 <a href="mailto:bondolo@dev.java.net">bondolo@dev.java.net</a>)<br>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>We encourage everybody to participate in the project. There are a number of
  ways community members can contribute to JXSE. Each level of contribution  
  requires additional commitment of your time. Most people usually start out  
  with smallercommitments and then work their way up as their personal schedules  
  and priorities permit.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Tester</b> : Found a problem in a previous release? Interested in a 
      feature in an upcoming release? There is no better way to make sure it's 
      perfect than to try it out for yourself! You can also contribute by 
      creating new tests, adding to the benchmarking suite and to the JDF
      distributed testing project.

      <p>In order to be a tester you should subscribe to the JXTA dev discussion
      forum. See 
      <a href="/servlets/ProjectForumView">JXSE Discussion Forums</a>.
      You also want to become a project Observer or Developer in order to be 
      able to modify the Issuezila database. You may also wish to become a 
      Developer on the <a href="http://jxta-bench.dev.java.net">JXTA Benchmarking</a>
      project in order to be able to add additional tests. See the <a href=
      "https://jxta.dev.java.net/govern.htm">JXTA Governance</a> and
      <a href="/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">Request Project Role</a>
      pages to sign up!</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Reviewer</b> : A JXTA expert but don't have a lot of time to work on 
      tasks? Trying to learn more about how JXTA is put together? Become a 
      reviewer! Reviewers commit to devoting time to monitor and provide 
      feedback on specific tasks. The most careful review is usually needed 
      before code is committed for a task, but you can provide insight or 
      comment on the ongoing progress of a task at any time. Scan the 
      <a href="/issues/">Issuezilla  database</a> for tasks which interest you 
      or look for issues with the keyword "Review". Sign your self up by adding 
      your name to the issue "cc:" list!

      <p>In order to become a reviewer you should be an Observer or Developer on
      the JXSE project. See the <a href=
      "https://jxta.dev.java.net/govern.htm">JXTA Governance</a> and
      <a href="/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">Request Project Role</a>
      pages to sign up!</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Task Leader</b> : Got a great idea? You can lead tasks for inclusion 
      within a JXSE release. This usually involves coding, preparing 
      documentation and unit tests, submitting code for pre-commit review and 
      working with testers and community members to integrate your task into the
      release. You will also normally be expected to be willing to act as a
      reviewer for other tasks.

      <p>In order to become a reviewer you should be an Developer on
      the JXSE project. See the <a href=
      "https://jxta.dev.java.net/govern.htm">JXTA Governance</a> and
      <a href="/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">Request Project Role</a>
      pages to sign up!</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Release Team</b> : You can join the team which manages the release 
      cycle for JXSE. This usually involves a lot of regression testing,
      integration testing, code commit reviews, writing release notes, tracking 
      tasks and bugs. Early in the release cycle you will work with task leaders
      to establish the tasks to be included in the upcoming release. Most 
      release team members will be task leaders for one or more tasks that will 
      be part of the upcoming release.

      <p>In order to become a member of the release team you should be Developer
      or Project Owner on the JXE project. See the <a href=
      "https://jxta.dev.java.net/govern.htm">JXTA Governance</a> and
      <a href="/servlets/ProjectMembershipRequest">Request Project Role</a>
      pages to sign up!</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tasks</h2>

  <p>Each JXSE release will try to advance the project by adding new 
  features or improving upon existing features. Each improvement is tracked as a
  task so that it's progress can be monitored and it can be discussed more 
  effectively by the community.</p>

  <p>Each task is associated with the particular release, the release in which
  it is expected to be included. Each task also has a leader. The leader of a 
  task is reponsible for reporting information about the progress of tasks 
  either to the appropriate JXTA mailing lists or via Issuezilla. The task 
  leader is also likely the person completing the work.</p>

  <p><b>Any community member can create a new task for a release. For now, 
  creating new tasks requires that you also commit to leading the task and 
  completing the work. You can also volunteer to work on existing tasks or 
  create tasks based upon suggestions by others.</b></p>

  <p>New tasks should be proposed on the 
  <a href="mailto:dev@jxta.dev.java.net">JXTA Dev mailing list</a>. Discussion 
  about existing tasks should be discussed on its Issuezilla issue or on the 
  <a href="/servlets/ForumMessageList?forumID=2724">JXSE DEV Forum</a>.</p>

  <h2>Committer Policies</h2>

  <p>The JXSE project has evolved a flexible, informal policy for how code
  is developed and committed. Most JXTA projects use the 
  <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html">Apache Voting Rules</a> 
  process with either a 
  "<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#ReviewThenCommit">Review Then Commit</a>" (RTC) 
  or 
  "<a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#CommitThenReview">Commit Then Review</a>" (CTR) 
  policy. These "rules" apply to the <b>Platform</b>, <b>CMS</b> and, with 
  exceptions noted below, to the <b>Shell</b>. All of the JXSE projects use
  the CTR process during normal development but between beta and final releases
  we require that any significant issues be reviewed before commit.</p>

  <p>All code to be committed to the <b>JXTA-JXSE</b>, <b>CMS</b> and <b>Shell</b>
  projects must be compatible with Java SE 5.0 and with the 
  <a href="conventions.html">JXSE Coding Conventions</a>. You are encouraged
  to test your submissions on a variety of computer platforms and with a variety
  of Java Virtual Machines.</p>

  <p>These conventions have always been applied informally. Good judgement and 
  selective application has always been preferred to strict adherence.</p>

  <h2>Creation of Bugzilla Issues</h2>

  <p>Historically, the <b>Platform</b> project has made extensive use of the 
  Issuezilla database 
  (<a href="/issues/">Platform Issue Tracker</a>) as a 
  focus for development. "Bug" issues are commonly created for defects, new 
  features, patches and tasks. Issues provide a convenient forum for discussion 
  of defect reports, design proposals, patches and resolutions.</p>

  <p>There are some types of issues and bugs which traditionally have not 
  resulted in a formal bugzilla issue being created. These normally include; 
  updates to JavaDoc, comments, spelling corrections, logging changes, most 
  <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net">PMD</a> nits, web site changes, most 
  changes to build scripts and packaging.</p>

  <p>For a little larger changes, such as minor code cleanups, some more complex
  <a href= "http://pmd.sourceforge.net">PMD</a> nits, and very narrow minor bug 
  fixes (e.g. throw IAE at the beginning of a method rather than allowing an NPE 
  10 lines later)  we have generally done limited peer reviews and not created a 
  Bugzilla issue. The peer review is normally done informally via email, IM, IRC, 
  phone, over the shoulder, etc. These peer reviews are not intended to be a 
  thorough indepth reviews, rather they are "No, you're not crazy" or "Maybe you 
  should create an issue for this" checks.</p>

  <p>For any behaviour changes, API signature changes, most bug fixes, anything 
  potentially warranting discussion a Bugzilla issue must be created. The 
  discussion and review process varies greatly depending upon the nature and 
  complexity of the isssue involved. Developers are responsible for seeking 
  appropriate review and comment before commit as appropriate. When in doubt,
  seek more review and comment.</p>

  <h2>Important Exceptions and the Shell Project</h2>

  <p>There are some exceptions to the preceeding rules. In particular, the 
  <b>Shell</b> project has never made much use of the Issuzilla database. 
  Committers to the <b>Shell</b> project are encouraged to simply follow their
  best judgement and be mindful not to break features. <b>Shell</b> committers 
  should also pay attention to release plans and avoid committing big changes 
  immediately before a planned release.</p>

  <p>Any <tt>test</tt> directories are also special in that unlike all other 
  portions of a project, you are actively encouraged to commit code which
  <i>fails</i> against the current source tree. All commits to the <tt>test</tt>
  directory should indicate a Bugzilla issue which should describe the nature of
  the test and the cause of the breakage.</p>
