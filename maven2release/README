This directory defines a pseudo-Maven project for use in deploying the
JXSE build to the java.net Maven repository.  It is not intended to be
a Maven encapsulation of the JXSE project build.

To build, first build the JXSE distribution by executing 'and dist'
in the jxta-jxse base directory.  Then, execute the following
command:

        ant -Dnet.jxta.build.version=<ver1> -Dnet.jxta.maven.version=<ver2>

WHERE:

ver1    The JXSE build version (e.g., 2.5, 20080812).  This version must be
        the same version string that was used/generated when JXSE was
	built.  This version string is used to identify the files in the
	jxta-jxse/dist/ directory.

ver2    The Maven artifact version (e.g., 2.5, 2.5.1-SNAPSHOT).  This version
        is used in the POM for the jxta-jxse artifact.
