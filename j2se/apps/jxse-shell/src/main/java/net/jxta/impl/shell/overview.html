The JXTA Shell provides an interactive environment to the JXTA platform. The
Shell provides basic commands to discover peers and peergroups, to join and
resign from peergroups, to create pipes between peers, and to send pipe
messages.

<p/>The Shell provides environment variables that permit binding symbolic
names to JXTA platform objects. Environment variables allow Shell commands
to exchange data. The command 'env' displays all defined environment
variables in the current Shell session.

<p/>The Shell creates a JXTA InputPipe (<code>stdin</code>) for reading
input from the keyboard, and a JXTA OutputPipe (<code>stdout</code>) to
display information on the Shell console. All commands executed by the Shell
have their initial <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> set up to the
Shell's stdin and stdout pipes. The Shell also creates the environment
variable <code>stdgroup</code> that contains the current JXTA PeerGroup in
which the Shell and commands are executed.

<p/>The <code>man</code> command is available to list the commands available.
Type <code>man <i>&lt;command&gt;</i></code> to get help about a particular
command.
