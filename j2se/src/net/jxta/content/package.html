Content objects are container objects that can hold arbitrary data and are
associated with a JXTA ID (replacing the older Codat API).  This package is
intended to provide a definition of Content as well as provide an interface
to share and reetrieve the Content to and from remote peers.
<p/>
This API may appear to be quite complex for such a simple task.  This is
due to the fact that it was designed to be able to provide a unified front-end
to the programmer while retaining the option to host multiple transfer
implementations concurrently.  Since each transfer implementation may have it's
own specific controls and telemetry, this package was designed such that objects
created for the user by each transfer implementation would be directly
accessible by the user, allowing for polymorphic checks to expose more
functionality than appears in this common API.
<p/>
For most uses, the following are probably the best entry point into
this package:
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>Content</code>: The container for arbitary data
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>ContentService</code>: Allows Content to be shared and retrieved
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>ContentShare</code>: Represents Content which has been made
        available to remote peers
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>ContentTransfer</code>: Represents Content which has been made
        available by one or more remote peers and is being retrieved to this
        peer
    </li>
</ul>
